I have a very strange fear. I always fear that if I show any difference in my mood to any of my friends they might catch it as inconsistency, and it will make them lose trust in me.

Also, why am I feeling like the use of AI feels unethical? It is starting to feel like eating junk food, or drinking alcohol, or smoking. It has some kind of bitter taste. Some shame. Why? Is it our obsession with our species, aka our survival instinct, that has made the "humanity over everything" an unquestionable value? Why do I need to always prioritize human connection?
