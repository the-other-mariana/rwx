**`rwx`** is a blog where thoughts are put so that maybe they make more sense in the future when I look back at these paragraphs. Kind of reminds me of Leo Tolstoy's idea of that says something along the lines of: the past, when looked at in retrospect, it looks like destiny; but when it was the present, it felt like freedom.
